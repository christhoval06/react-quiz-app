<h1>Project 3 - Star Wars Quiz App</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>For our third project, we created a single page app that was a quiz about any topic/genre we wanted. I chose Star Wars naturally. We used React JS and also practiced using ES2015 to build our app. The features of our single webpage include an introduction page, 3 timed quiz questions, results pages (fail or pass), and a 404 error page. CSS animations were also used to add visuals to select pages. The end result required the user the answer all three questions correctly (within a 1 minute time limit) before being accepted into a Star Wars fan club.</p>

<h2>Languages and tools used:</h2>
<ul>
<li>React JS (ES2015)</li>
<li>CSS/SASS (animations)</li>
<li>Webpack (browsersync)</li>
<li>Git/Github</li>
</ul>

<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
<p>Every single person in my class struggled with this project. React has a very high learning curve but once you understand key concepts such as this_stats and this_props, patterns start to appear making it easier to understand and code. React's modular structure really  helped me organize and write my code methodically, which I really enjoyed. I see a lot of potential in React as you can branch off into React Native once you have a solid understanding of React. I look forward to working with this language in the future.</p>
